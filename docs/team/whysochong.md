### Project: AddressBook Level 3

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Create profiles based on limited student information.
  * What it does: This makes certain information fields optional to fill in, so that teacher assistants can create a profile for the students without needing to know/fill in all information.
  * Justification: This feature helps teacher assistants to add student's profile flexibly based on the limited student information that they have on the students.
  * Highlights: Optional fields can be left blank. Teaching assistants can use the edit feature if they want fill in those optional fields in the future.

* **New Feature**: Added deadlines to Task Book.
  * What it does: This allows teaching assistants to add in their daily tasks and their deadlines, so that it will remind them to complete the task before it expires.
  * Justification: Some tasks are time-sensitive, therefore it is important to note down the deadline, so that it can act as a reminder to complete the task.
  * Highlights: The deadline of a task can be changed using the edit-task feature.
